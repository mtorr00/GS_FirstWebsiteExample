      <p>Interesting Wikipedia Excerpts</p>

            <h2>John Carmack Wikipedia Article</h3>            
            <p>John Carmack might be one of the greatest programmers of the modern era. His thoughts on modern programming and the state of the modern programmer, as well as languages and how languages have evolved over time have really made me interested in learning how to adapt to the more modernization of programming.</p>
            <p class="p2">John D. Carmack II[1] (born August 20, 1970)[1] is an American computer programmer and video game developer. He co-founded the video game company id Software and was the lead programmer of its 1990s games Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake, and their sequels. Carmack made innovations in 3D computer graphics, such as his Carmack's Reverse algorithm for shadow volumes. In 2013, he resigned from id Software to work full-time at Oculus VR as their CTO. In 2019, he reduced his role to Consulting CTO so he could allocate more time toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).[3]</p>

            <h2>Artificial General Intelligence Wikipedia Article</h3>
            <p>Another interesting topic is on AI and how it might impact the programming world as well. There are already various services to help aid a programmer through autocompleting their typing, but there are even systems out there that might be able to implement entire ideas and algorithms without much need for a human programmer to interfere.</p>
            <p class="p2">Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.[1][2] It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI can also be referred to as strong AI,[3][4][5] full AI,[6] or general intelligent action,[7] although some academic sources reserve the term "strong AI" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness.[a]

                In contrast to strong AI, weak AI[8] or "narrow AI"[4] is not intended to have general cognitive abilities; rather, weak AI is any program that is designed to solve exactly one problem. (Academic sources reserve "weak AI" for programs that do not experience consciousness or do not have a mind in the same sense people do.)[a] A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI R&D projects spread across 37 countries.[9]</p>

            <h2>Cognition Wikipedia Article</h3>
            <p>It is definitely good to know the limits of our own learning and understanding, which can help make learning new things easier and more efficient. As a concept, cognitive processes are definitely important when learning and adapting to new code bases in industry.</p>
            <p class="p2">Cognition (/kɒɡˈnɪʃ(ə)n/ (listen)) refers to "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses".[2] It encompasses all aspects of intellectual functions and processes such as: perception, attention, thought, intelligence, the formation of knowledge, memory and working memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and computation, problem solving and decision making, comprehension and production of language. Imagination is also a cognitive process, it is considered as such because it involves thinking about possibilities. Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and discover new knowledge.

                Cognitive processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, musicology, anesthesia, neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, biology, systemics, logic, and computer science.[3] These and other approaches to the analysis of cognition (such as embodied cognition) are synthesized in the developing field of cognitive science, a progressively autonomous academic discipline.</p>
